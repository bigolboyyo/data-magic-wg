## Progress Made

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing multistrata agroforestry systems to help reverse climate change. Multistrata agroforestry is a type of agroforestry that involves growing multiple crops and trees in the same area. This type of agroforestry has been shown to be more efficient in terms of land use and can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

One of the main benefits of multistrata agroforestry is that it can help to improve soil health. This is because the different crops and trees that are grown in a multistrata system can help to add diversity to the soil, which can improve its overall health. Additionally, the roots of the different plants in a multistrata system can help to hold the soil in place, which can reduce erosion.

Another benefit of multistrata agroforestry is that it can help to reduce the need for chemical inputs. This is because the different plants in a multistrata system can help to provide natural pest control and can also improve the soil quality, which can reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers.

Overall, multistrata agroforestry is a promising approach to reversing climate change. The main benefits of this type of agroforestry are that it can help to improve soil health, reduce the need for chemical inputs, and improve land use efficiency. Additionally, there have been a number of new technologies developed in recent years that can help to make multistrata agroforestry more efficient and effective.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Multistrata Agroforestry to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of diversification, the need for management strategies that consider both biophysical and socio-economic factors, and the role of stakeholder engagement in successful implementation. Additionally, while Multistrata Agroforestry has shown success in mitigating the effects of climate change, there have also been failures associated with the technology, such as the establishment of monoculture plantations and the lack of long-term planning.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenge that remains in the development and implementation of Multistrata Agroforestry to reverse climate change is the need to overcome obstacles to scaling up and widely adopting this technology.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Multistrata Agroforestry to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to research and develop the technology so that it can be adopted on a large scale. In order to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective, steps need to be taken to educate farmers on the benefits of this technology and to provide incentives for them to adopt it.
