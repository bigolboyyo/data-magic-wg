## Progress Made

The production of Portland cement, the most common type of cement, accounts for approximately 5% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, making it one of the world’s leading sources of industrial carbon dioxide emissions. In order to reduce these emissions, the cement industry has begun to explore the development of alternative cements that require less energy to produce and result in a lower carbon footprint.

One such alternative is known as “geopolymer cement”. Geopolymer cements are made from industrial wastes such as fly ash and slag, which would otherwise be disposed of in landfills. These materials are mixed with an alkaline solution to create a geopolymer gel, which can then be used to bind together aggregates to create a concrete-like material. Geopolymer cements require less energy to produce than Portland cement, and can result in a carbon footprint that is up to 80% lower.

Another alternative cement that is being developed is known as “magnesium oxide cement”. Magnesium oxide cement is made from magnesium oxide (MgO), which is a waste product of the magnesium production process. MgO is mixed with water to create a slurry, which is then mixed with an aggregate to create a concrete-like material. Magnesium oxide cements are non-toxic, fire resistant, and have a lower carbon footprint than Portland cement.

The development of alternative cements is a promising area of research that has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the cement industry.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Alternative Cement to mitigate the effects of climate change are as follows:

Successes:

1. Alternative cement has been shown to be an effective means of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

2. The technology has been successfully implemented in a number of countries, resulting in significant emissions reductions.

3. Alternative cement has been shown to be durable and long-lasting, with minimal maintenance required.

4. The technology is relatively low-cost and can be easily adopted by cement manufacturers.

Failures:

1. Alternative cement has not been widely adopted due to a lack of awareness of its benefits.

2. The technology has not been implemented in a number of countries due to the high cost of investment.

3. Alternative cement has not been shown to be effective in all areas, with some studies showing it to be inferior to traditional cement in terms of strength and durability.

4. There has been a lack of standardization in the manufacturing of alternative cement, which has resulted in inconsistent quality.

## Challenges Ahead

There are a few major challenges that need to be overcome to develop and implement Alternative Cement on a larger scale:

1. Cost: Alternative Cement is currently more expensive to produce than traditional cement. This is a major barrier to widespread adoption.

2. Infrastructure: Alternative Cement requires different infrastructure than traditional cement. This includes different manufacturing plants, different transportation, and different construction methods.

3. Awareness: Alternative Cement is a new technology and many people are not aware of it. This includes both the general public and the construction industry.

4. Standards: Alternative Cement needs to meet the same standards as traditional cement in order to be widely adopted.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Alternative Cement to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to invest in research and development to improve the technology and make it more affordable. Additionally, policy measures should be put in place to encourage the use of Alternative Cement, such as tax incentives or mandates.
