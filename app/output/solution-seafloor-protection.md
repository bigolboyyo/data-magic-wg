## Progress Made

In the last few years, there has been increasing interest in using the seafloor to help reverse climate change. This is because the seafloor is a huge store of carbon, and if we can find ways to sequester carbon on the seafloor, it could help reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.

One promising approach is to use iron-rich minerals to promote the growth of phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are tiny marine plants that absorb carbon dioxide and convert it into organic matter. When they die, they sink to the seafloor, taking the carbon with them. This process, known as ocean iron fertilization, has the potential to sequester large amounts of carbon on the seafloor.

Several companies are now developing technologies to enable ocean iron fertilization. One such company is Ocean Quest, which is developing a system that will pump iron-rich water into the ocean from a ship. The system is designed to be highly efficient, and the company estimates that it could remove up to 30 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year.

Other companies are developing seafloor mineral resources that could be used to sequester carbon. For example, Seaweed Energy Solutions is developing a process to extract magnesium from seawater. Magnesium carbonate can be used to create a solid material that can be used to store carbon dioxide.

These are just a few examples of the many innovative technologies that are being developed to help reverse climate change. As we continue to research and develop new ways to sequester carbon on the seafloor, we will get closer and closer to achieving our goal of reversing climate change.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Seafloor Protection to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of:

1. Understanding the seafloor environment and the processes that drive change
2. Designing systems that are adaptable and responsive to changes in the seafloor environment
3. Incorporating seafloor protection into coastal management and planning
4. Monitoring and evaluating the performance of seafloor protection systems

Some of the successes associated with the technology include its ability to protect coastal areas from erosion and flooding, as well as its potential to help mitigate the impacts of climate change. However, there have also been some failures associated with the technology, such as its inability to prevent all coastal damage from storms and its potential to cause environmental damage.

## Challenges Ahead

Major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Seafloor Protection to reverse climate change include:

1. The need for more research to understand the potential impacts of this technology on the environment and climate.

2. The need to develop cost-effective methods for deploying and maintaining the systems.

3. The need to gain international acceptance of the technology and its benefits.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Seafloor Protection to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to ensure that the technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective. Steps that need to be taken to ensure this include:

1. Increasing awareness of the technology and its potential benefits among policymakers, the business community, and the general public.

2. Conducting more research to develop a better understanding of the technology and its potential applications.

3. Working with governments and businesses to promote the adoption of the technology.

4. Evaluating the effectiveness of the technology once it has been implemented on a large scale.
