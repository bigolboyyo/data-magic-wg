## Progress Made

There have been many breakthrough technologies that have been developed in order to make cities more walkable and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some of these technologies include:

1. Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles are a great way to reduce emissions in cities, as they do not produce any emissions themselves. Additionally, they are much quieter than traditional petrol or diesel vehicles, making them ideal for use in urban areas.

2. Solar power: Solar power can be used to power electric vehicles, as well as to provide energy for streetlights and other urban infrastructure.

3. LED lighting: LED lighting is much more energy-efficient than traditional lighting, and can help to reduce emissions from streetlights and other urban lighting.

4. Smart city technology: Smart city technology can be used to help reduce traffic congestion and emissions from transportation. Additionally, it can help to improve the efficiency of urban infrastructure, such as water and waste management.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Walkable Cities to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of planning and designing for walking, the need for a comprehensive approach that includes infrastructure and land use planning, and the need to engage the community in the planning process.

One success associated with the technology is that it has been shown to be effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A study in Portland, Oregon found that if 10 percent of trips were made by foot or bike instead of by car, it would result in a reduction of 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.

A failure associated with the technology is that it has not been widely adopted. One reason for this is that many cities are not designed for walking, and it can be difficult to retrofit existing infrastructure. Another reason is that there is a lack of political will to invest in walking infrastructure.

## Challenges Ahead

There are several challenges that need to be addressed in order to make walkable cities a reality. First, there needs to be a shift in public perception in order to make walking a more acceptable mode of transportation. This can be done through education and awareness campaigns that highlight the benefits of walking, such as improved health and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Second, the built environment needs to be designed in a way that makes walking more convenient and appealing. This includes creating safe and well-lit pedestrian infrastructure, such as sidewalks and crosswalks, and making sure that destinations are located within walking distance of each other. Third, the transportation system needs to be reformed to give priority to walking and public transit over private vehicles. This can be done by implementing policies that discourage car use, such as congestion pricing, and investing in public transit options that are efficient and accessible.

## Best Path Forward

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Walkable Cities will vary depending on the specific context and needs of each city. However, some general steps that need to be taken to ensure that Walkable Cities are effective in mitigating the effects of climate change include:

1. Ensuring that walkability is integrated into urban planning and design from the outset. This means considering things like pedestrian infrastructure and connectivity when planning new developments, and retrofitting existing developments where possible.

2. Promoting and incentivizing walking and other forms of active transportation. This can be done through measures like implementing pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly policies, providing dedicated infrastructure for active transportation, and offering financial incentives for walking or biking instead of driving.

3. Creating a comprehensive data-driven approach to walkability. This means collecting data on things like pedestrian activity and using it to inform decision-making around things like infrastructure development and land-use planning.

4. Engaging with the community to get feedback on walking conditions and identify areas for improvement. This can be done through things like conducting surveys and focus groups, and using social media to crowdsource information.

5. Evaluating the effectiveness of Walkable Cities initiatives on a regular basis. This includes setting measurable goals and objectives, and conducting regular impact assessments to track progress.
