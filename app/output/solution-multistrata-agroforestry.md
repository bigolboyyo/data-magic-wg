## Progress Made

One of the most promising breakthrough technologies for Net Zero Buildings is the use of Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). BIPV technology allows buildings to generate their own electricity, using solar panels that are built into the structure of the building itself. This is a significant improvement over traditional solar panel technology, which requires the installation of separate solar panels on the roof of a building. BIPV technology has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings by eliminating the need for electricity generated by fossil fuels.

Another breakthrough technology that is being developed for Net Zero Buildings is the use of Building-Integrated Wind Turbines (BIWT). BIWT technology allows buildings to generate their own electricity, using wind turbines that are built into the structure of the building itself. This is a significant improvement over traditional wind turbine technology, which requires the installation of separate wind turbines on the roof of a building. BIWT technology has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings by eliminating the need for electricity generated by fossil fuels.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Net Zero Buildings to mitigate the effects of climate change include:

1. The importance of an integrated approach: Net Zero Buildings need to be designed and built as part of an integrated approach that takes into account the whole building life cycle. This includes the need for an energy efficient building envelope, the use of renewable energy technologies, and the need for an intelligent control system to manage the buildingâ€™s energy use.

2. The need for a holistic approach to design: The design of Net Zero Buildings needs to take into account the whole building and its environment, including the microclimate, the local energy resources, and the needs of the occupants.

3. The importance of user engagement: Net Zero Buildings need to be designed with the user in mind. The building should be designed to meet the needs of the occupants, and the occupants should be involved in the design and operation of the building.

4. The need for ongoing operation and maintenance: Net Zero Buildings need to be operated and maintained properly to ensure that they continue to perform as intended. This includes regular monitoring and maintenance of the building envelope and the renewable energy systems.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Net Zero Buildings to reverse climate change are:

1. Cost: The initial cost of constructing a Net Zero Building is often higher than that of a traditional building. However, the long-term cost savings from reduced energy and water consumption can offset the initial investment.

2. Lack of awareness: There is still a lack of awareness about the benefits of Net Zero Buildings. This needs to be addressed through education and outreach programmes.

3. Implementation: There are a number of technical challenges associated with the implementation of Net Zero Buildings. These need to be overcome in order to scale up and widely adopt this technology.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Net Zero Buildings is to ensure that the technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective. Steps that need to be taken to ensure this include:

1. Increasing awareness of the benefits of net zero buildings among the general public, policy makers, and the building industry.

2. Supporting research and development of net zero building technologies.

3. Encouraging the adoption of net zero building standards and regulations.

4. Providing incentives for the adoption of net zero buildings.

5. Monitoring and evaluating the performance of net zero buildings.
