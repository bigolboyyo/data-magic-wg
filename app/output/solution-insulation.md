## Progress Made

In the last few years, there have been significant breakthroughs in the technology used to capture methane emissions from landfills. One of the most promising new technologies is the use of a landfill gas-to-energy system, which converts methane into electricity. This technology has been successfully piloted at a number of landfills around the world and is now being scaled up to provide power to homes and businesses.

Another breakthrough technology is the use of a landfill gas capture system, which captures methane before it is released into the atmosphere. This technology is being piloted at a number of landfills in the United States and is expected to be widely adopted in the coming years.

These new technologies are expected to have a significant impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from landfills. In the United States, it is estimated that these technologies could reduce methane emissions from landfills by up to 90%. This would represent a significant reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere and would help to mitigate the effects of climate change.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Landfill Methane Capture to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of siting the landfill in an area with good drainage, using a liner to prevent methane and other gases from escaping, and using a gas collection system to capture the methane. Additionally, it is important to monitor the landfill regularly to ensure that the gas collection system is functioning properly and that methane levels are not increasing.

One success associated with Landfill Methane Capture is that it can significantly reduce methane emissions from landfills. For example, a study in the United States found that installing a gas collection system at a landfill reduced methane emissions by up to 99%. Additionally, Landfill Methane Capture can provide a source of renewable energy. For example, the methane captured at a landfill can be used to generate electricity or to power vehicles.

However, there are also some failures associated with Landfill Methane Capture. One challenge is that the technology is expensive to install and operate. Additionally, it can be difficult to find a market for the methane that is captured, as it is a relatively low-quality gas.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Landfill Methane Capture to reverse climate change are:

- The high cost of installing and maintaining the technology
- The need for a continuous and reliable supply of methane
- The need for trained personnel to operate and maintain the technology
- The need for a market for the captured methane

## Best Path Forward

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of landfill methane capture will vary depending on the specific context and needs of each community. However, some general steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing awareness of the benefits of landfill methane capture.

2. Providing financial incentives for communities to adopt landfill methane capture technology.

3. Establishing regulations or voluntary standards that require or encourage the use of landfill methane capture technology.

4. Supporting research and development efforts to improve the effectiveness of landfill methane capture technology.
