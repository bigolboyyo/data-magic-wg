## Progress Made

The concept of sustainable intensification for smallholders has been gaining traction in recent years as a way to address the challenge of climate change. A number of breakthrough technologies have been developed that have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. These include precision agriculture technologies that allow for more targeted and efficient use of inputs, as well as new agroforestry systems that integrate trees into traditional farming landscapes. When properly implemented, these and other sustainable intensification practices have the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of small-scale agriculture.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders to mitigate the effects of climate change include the following:

1. It is important to involve smallholders in the design and implementation of the technology from the outset.

2. The technology needs to be affordable and accessible to smallholders.

3. It is important to tailor the technology to the specific needs of smallholders.

4. The technology needs to be easy to use and maintain.

5. Smallholders need to be given training and support in using the technology.

6. The technology needs to be monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis.

7. It is important to address the social, economic and environmental aspects of the technology.

8. The technology needs to be scalable and replicable.

9. It is important to create an enabling environment for the technology.

10. The technology needs to be continuously improved.

## Challenges Ahead

The challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders to reverse climate change include:

1. Increasing awareness and understanding of the concept of sustainable intensification among smallholder farmers.

2. Demonstrating the benefits of sustainable intensification in terms of increased yields and improved livelihoods.

3. Overcoming the barriers to adopting sustainable intensification practices, including the lack of information and knowledge, the high costs, and the lack of infrastructure.

4. Scaling up and widely adopting sustainable intensification practices in order to make a significant impact on climate change.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change would be to ensure that the technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective. To do this, steps need to be taken to ensure that the technology is accessible to smallholders, that it is affordable, and that it is easy to use. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the technology is effective in mitigating the effects of climate change. To do this, it is important to monitor the effects of climate change on smallholders and their land, and to adjust the technology accordingly.
