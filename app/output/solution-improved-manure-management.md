## Progress Made

Some progress has been made in developing Improved Manure Management to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Examples of breakthrough technologies that have contributed to this progress include:

1. Anaerobic digestion: This is a process that breaks down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, producing methane gas which can be used as a renewable energy source. This technology can be used to treat manure and other organic waste, reducing methane emissions from these sources.

2. Crop residues: Using crop residues such as straw and stalks for animal bedding can decrease the amount of methane emitted from manure.

3. Nutrient management: Managing the nutrients in manure can help reduce emissions of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Nutrient management strategies include using cover crops, applying manure to cropland only when plants are actively growing, and timing manure applications to coincide with when crops need the nutrients the most.

4. Manure storage: Storing manure in anaerobic lagoons or covered pits can decrease methane emissions.

5. Methane capture: Methane can be captured from manure and used as a renewable energy source. This reduces emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Improved Manure Management to mitigate the effects of climate change include:

1. The technology can be successful in reducing methane emissions from manure, but only if it is properly designed and managed.

2. The technology is most effective when used in combination with other methane mitigation strategies, such as manure collection and storage.

3. There can be significant financial and environmental benefits from implementing Improved Manure Management, but these benefits must be weighed against the costs of installation and operation.

## Challenges Ahead

The challenges faced by the development and implementation of improved manure management are:

1. Ensuring that manure is managed in a way that reduces methane emissions

2. Reducing the overall carbon footprint of livestock production

3. Increasing the efficiency of manure use in agriculture

4. Improving the sustainability of livestock production systems

5. Addressing the challenges associated with manure storage and handling

6. Ensuring that manure management practices are economically viable

7. Addressing the challenges associated with public acceptability of manure management practices.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Improved Manure Management to mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue research and development to improve the technology and to promote its adoption on a large scale. Steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing awareness of the technology and its benefits among farmers and other potential users.

2. Providing incentives for farmers to adopt the technology, such as subsidies or tax breaks.

3. Conducting research to improve the technology and to develop new applications for it.

4. Working with farmers to test and implement the technology on their farms.

5. Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the technology in mitigating the effects of climate change.
