## Progress Made

In the past few years, there has been significant progress made in developing nutrient management strategies to reverse climate change. One example of a breakthrough technology that has been developed is the use of precision agriculture to more efficiently use fertilizer and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other examples include the use of anaerobic digestion to recycle nutrients and the use of cover crops to reduce nutrient runoff.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons learned in the development and implementation of Nutrient Management to mitigate the effects of climate change include the following:

1. Nutrient management is an effective tool for mitigating the effects of climate change.

2. Nutrient management can be used to improve crop yields and water quality.

3. Nutrient management can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

4. Nutrient management can be used to improve soil health.

5. Nutrient management can be used to reduce the need for chemical fertilizers.

6. Nutrient management can be used to improve the efficiency of irrigation.

7. Nutrient management can be used to reduce the impact of floods and droughts.

8. Nutrient management can help reduce the cost of food production.

9. Nutrient management can help improve the quality of food.

10. Nutrient management can help improve the safety of food.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Nutrient Management to reverse climate change are:

1. Ensuring that nutrients are applied to soils in the right amounts and at the right time.

2. Improving the efficiency of nutrient use so that less is lost to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases.

3. Encouraging farmers to adopt nutrient management practices.

4. Creating incentives for farmers to adopt nutrient management practices.

5. Overcoming resistance to change from the fertilizer industry.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Nutrient Management is to continue to support and invest in research and development of the technology. In addition, it is important to provide incentives for farmers to adopt Nutrient Management practices, and to disseminate information about the benefits of the technology.
