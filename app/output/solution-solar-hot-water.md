## Progress Made

Solar hot water technology has progressed rapidly in recent years, with many new breakthrough technologies emerging. One example is the development of photovoltaic (PV) panels, which can be used to generate electricity from sunlight. PV panels have been shown to be highly effective at generating electricity, and their use has been growing rapidly around the world. PV panels are now being used to power homes, businesses and even entire villages in some cases. Another example of a breakthrough solar hot water technology is the development of solar thermal collectors. Solar thermal collectors are able to capture the heat from the sun and use it to heat water or air. This technology is becoming increasingly popular as it is a very efficient way to generate heat energy. Solar thermal collectors are now being used in a wide range of applications, including domestic hot water heating, space heating and even industrial process heating.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Solar Hot Water to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of proper installation, the need for regular maintenance, and the importance of using quality materials. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the system is sized correctly for the needs of the household or business, and that it is located in an area that receives adequate sunlight.

Solar hot water systems can be very successful in mitigating the effects of climate change, but they can also fail if they are not properly installed or maintained. For example, if a solar hot water system is not installed correctly, it may not work properly and could even cause damage to the roof or building. Additionally, if a system is not regularly maintained, it may not work as efficiently as it could, and the build-up of dirt and debris can eventually lead to system failure.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenge that remains in the development and implementation of Solar Hot Water to reverse climate change is the cost. Solar Hot Water is a expensive technology and it is not widely adopted because of the cost. The other challenge is the installation and maintenance of Solar Hot Water. Solar Hot Water is a complex technology and it requires trained personnel to install and maintain it.

## Best Path Forward

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of solar hot water will vary depending on the specific context and needs of each community. However, some general steps that could be taken to promote the large-scale adoption of solar hot water technology include:

1. Increasing public awareness of solar hot water technology and its potential benefits.

2. Providing financial incentives for installing solar hot water systems, such as tax breaks or subsidies.

3. Establishing minimum energy performance standards for new buildings that require the installation of solar hot water systems.

4. Developing building code requirements that mandate the use of solar hot water systems in new construction.

5. Working with utilities to develop rate structures that encourage the use of solar hot water systems.
