## Progress Made

Some of the breakthrough technologies that have been developed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings include:

1. High-efficiency lighting systems: These systems use less energy to produce the same amount of light as traditional lighting systems, thus reducing the overall energy consumption of a building and the emissions associated with it.

2. High-efficiency heating and cooling systems: These systems use less energy to maintain comfortable temperatures in a building, thus reducing the overall energy consumption of a building and the emissions associated with it.

3. Building envelope insulation: This helps to keep a building’s interior temperature stable, thus reducing the energy consumption of the building and the emissions associated with it.

4. On-site renewable energy generation: This can offset a portion of a building’s energy consumption from the grid, thus reducing the emissions associated with the building.

## Lessons Learned

The key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Building Automation Systems to mitigate the effects of climate change include both successes and failures associated with the technology and its use.

Successes:

1. Building Automation Systems (BAS) have been successful in reducing energy consumption in buildings.

2. BAS have been successful in reducing emissions from buildings.

3. BAS have been successful in improving the comfort of occupants in buildings.

Failures:

1. BAS have been unsuccessful in reducing the cost of energy in buildings.

2. BAS have been unsuccessful in reducing the time required to maintain or operate buildings.

## Challenges Ahead

The challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Building Automation Systems to reverse climate change are mainly obstacles that need to be overcome to scale up and widely adopt this technology. The main challenges are:

1. Cost: The cost of Building Automation Systems is still relatively high compared to other energy efficiency measures. This high cost is a barrier to widespread adoption of the technology.

2. Lack of awareness: There is still a lack of awareness of the potential of Building Automation Systems to reduce energy consumption and emissions. This lack of awareness is a barrier to wider adoption of the technology.

3. Technical challenges: There are still some technical challenges associated with the implementation of Building Automation Systems. These challenges need to be overcome to ensure the technology works effectively and efficiently.

4. Standardization: There is still a lack of standardization in the Building Automation Systems industry. This lack of standardization makes it difficult to compare products and services and makes it difficult to scale up the technology.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Building Automation Systems to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to develop and improve the technology so that it is more effective and efficient, and to make sure that it is adopted on a large scale.
