## Progress Made

Significant progress has been made in developing Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaics (PV) to reverse climate change. In particular, significant advances have been made in the efficiency of PV cells, the development of new materials for PV cells, and the integration of PV cells into larger scale systems.

For example, in terms of efficiency, PV cells have been developed that are capable of converting over 40% of the incident sunlight into electricity. This is a significant improvement from the early days of PV when conversion efficiencies were in the low single digits.

In terms of materials, new types of PV cells have been developed that are made from materials such as perovskites and quantum dots. These new materials have a number of advantages over traditional PV materials, including higher efficiency and lower cost.

Finally, in terms of integration, PV cells are now being integrated into larger scale systems such as rooftops and solar farms. This allows for the efficient capture of solar energy on a much larger scale, which is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaics to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of siting, land use, water use, and environmental impacts. Additionally, the role of government incentives, financing, and policy in the development of solar PV projects has been critical in some cases and less so in others.

One of the major successes of solar PV has been its ability to be deployed quickly and at a large scale. This has been particularly important in the case of utility-scale projects, which can have a significant impact on carbon emissions.

However, there have also been some failures associated with solar PV. One of the biggest challenges has been its intermittency, which can lead to higher costs and lower efficiency. Additionally, the technology is still relatively new and there is a lack of standardization, which can make it difficult to compare different projects.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaics to reverse climate change are the high cost of solar panels, the need for more efficient solar cells, and the need for improved storage technologies.

## Best Path Forward

There are a few steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaics (USSPV) are adopted on a large scale and are effective in mitigating the effects of climate change. First, it is important to continue to develop this technology so that it is more efficient and cheaper to produce. Second, it is important to provide incentives for people and businesses to switch to USSPV. Finally, it is important to create regulations that require the use of USSPV in new construction and renovations.
