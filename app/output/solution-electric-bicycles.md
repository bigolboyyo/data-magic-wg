## Progress Made

Since the early 2000s, electric bicycles—also known as e-bikes—have been increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional bicycles. E-bikes are powered by electricity, typically from a battery, and can reach speeds of 20 miles per hour or more.

E-bikes have a number of potential advantages over traditional bicycles when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. First, they require no fossil fuels to operate, which means they produce zero emissions. Second, electric motors are typically more efficient than traditional bicycle pedals, meaning that e-bikes require less energy to travel the same distance as a traditional bicycle.

A number of breakthrough technologies have contributed to the development of electric bicycles. One key innovation has been the development of lithium-ion batteries, which are smaller, lighter, and more powerful than the lead-acid batteries typically used in earlier e-bike designs. Lithium-ion batteries have made it possible to create lighter, more portable e-bikes that can travel greater distances on a single charge.

Another key innovation has been the development of brushless DC motors, which are more efficient than traditional brushed DC motors and don’t require maintenance or replacement as often. Brushless motors are often used in conjunction with lithium-ion batteries to create powerful, efficient e-bikes.

A number of companies have developed electric bicycles that are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One example is the VanMoof Electrified, which is a lightweight e-bike that uses a lithium-ion battery and a brushless DC motor. The VanMoof Electrified has a range of up to 50 miles on a single charge, making it a great option for commuting or running errands around town.

Another example is the ProdecoTech Phantom X2, which is a heavier-duty e-bike that uses a lead-acid battery and a brushed DC motor. The Phantom X2 has a range of up to 30 miles on a single charge and is designed for riders who need a more robust e-bike for off-road riding or hauling heavy cargo.

Electric bicycles have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing a clean, efficient, and affordable transportation option.

## Lessons Learned

There are a number of key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Electric Bicycles (E-bikes) to mitigate the effects of climate change. One of the most important lessons is that E-bikes can be an effective means of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In fact, E-bikes have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by up to 95% compared to traditional petrol/diesel-powered vehicles.

Another key lesson is that E-bikes can help to reduce congestion and improve air quality. E-bikes emit no pollutants and so can help to improve local air quality. In addition, E-bikes can help to reduce congestion as they take up less space on the road than traditional cars.

Finally, it is important to note that the success of E-bikes as a mitigation tool will depend on a number of factors, including infrastructure, policy support, and consumer awareness. For example, in order for E-bikes to be successful in reducing GHG emissions, there needs to be a sufficient number of charging points available. In addition, policy support is important in order to create a favourable environment for E-bike use. Finally, consumer awareness is key in order to ensure that people are aware of the benefits of E-bikes and are willing to switch to this mode of transport.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of electric bicycles to reverse climate change are:

1. Costs: Electric bicycles are still more expensive than traditional bicycles, and this is a major obstacle to widespread adoption.

2. Infrastructure: There needs to be a better infrastructure in place to support electric bicycles, including more charging stations and dedicated bike lanes.

3. Public awareness: There needs to be greater public awareness of the benefits of electric bicycles in order to encourage more people to use them.

## Best Path Forward

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of electric bicycles will vary depending on the specific context and needs of each community. However, some general steps that could be taken to promote the large-scale adoption of electric bicycles include:

1. Increasing public awareness of the benefits of electric bicycles, including their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

2. Providing incentives for people to purchase or use electric bicycles, such as tax breaks or subsidies.

3. Investing in infrastructure to support electric bicycles, such as dedicated lanes or charging stations.

4. Enacting laws or regulations that mandate or encourage the use of electric bicycles in certain contexts, such as workplaces or school campuses.
