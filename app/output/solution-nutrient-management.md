## Progress Made

Over the past few years, there has been significant progress in developing ocean power to reverse climate change. One of the most important breakthrough technologies has been the development of floating wind turbines. These turbines can be placed in deep water, where they can capture more wind energy and generate more electricity than traditional land-based turbines. This is a major advance in harnessing the power of the oceans to generate clean energy.

Other breakthrough technologies include wave energy converters, which capture the energy of ocean waves and convert it into electricity, and tidal energy turbines, which harness the energy of the tides to generate electricity. These technologies are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to make a significant contribution to the fight against climate change.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Ocean Power to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of siting, the need for a robust design, the importance of environmental monitoring, and the need for a robust operations and maintenance regime. There have been both successes and failures associated with the technology and its use, but overall it has been shown to be a reliable and effective way to generate renewable energy.

## Challenges Ahead

There are a number of technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to make ocean power a more viable option for reversing climate change. One of the major challenges is developing a more efficient way to capture and convert the energy from waves and tides into electricity. Currently, ocean power plants have a low efficiency rate and are only able to capture a small fraction of the available energy. Another challenge is the high cost of construction and operation of ocean power plants. The cost of building and operating a wave or tide energy plant is currently much higher than traditional forms of power generation such as coal or natural gas. Finally, there are environmental concerns associated with the construction and operation of ocean power plants. These plants can have negative impacts on local ecosystems, including the displacement of marine life and the alteration of shoreline habitats.

## Best Path Forward

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of ocean power to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change will vary depending on the specific circumstances and needs of each community or region. However, some general steps that need to be taken to ensure that ocean power is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing public awareness and understanding of ocean power and its potential to mitigate the effects of climate change.

2. Supporting research and development of ocean power technologies to improve their efficiency and reduce costs.

3. Working with governments and other stakeholders to create policies and regulations that promote the use of ocean power.

4. Developing infrastructure to support the widespread adoption of ocean power, such as offshore wind farms and wave energy converters.

5. Ensuring that ocean power is used in an environmentally responsible way, such as avoiding impacts on marine life and minimizing the visual impact of offshore structures.
