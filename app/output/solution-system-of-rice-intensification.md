## Progress Made

The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a set of principles and practices that aim to increase the productivity of rice while reducing the inputs of water, fertilizer, and labor. The SRI is based on the premise that maximizing the growth and yield of rice is not simply a matter of increasing the inputs of water, fertilizer, and labor, but of improving the management of these inputs.

The adoption of SRI practices has been shown to increase rice yields by 20-50%, while reducing water use by 20-40%, fertilizer use by 20-50%, and labor use by 30-60%. These reductions in inputs result in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

The SRI has been adopted in over 50 countries, and continues to spread to new areas. The adoption of SRI practices is often constrained by a lack of knowledge and awareness, and by the lack of appropriate infrastructure and equipment. However, there have been a number of breakthrough technologies that have contributed to the spread of SRI and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

One such technology is the SRI Lander, which is a precision seeder that allows farmers to plant rice seeds at the optimal depth and spacing. The SRI Lander has been shown to increase yields by 20-30%, and to reduce water use by 30-40%.

Another technology that has contributed to the spread of SRI is the use of plastic mulch. Plastic mulch is used to cover the soil, which helps to conserve water and reduce evaporation. It also helps to control weeds, which reduces the need for herbicides and labor. Plastic mulch has been shown to increase yields by 10-20%, and to reduce water use by 20-30%.

The use of these and other technologies has contributed to the spread of SRI and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

## Lessons Learned

The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a methodology for improving the yield of rice crops while using fewer inputs. It was developed in the 1980s in Madagascar and has since been implemented in over 50 countries.

The key lessons that have been learned from the development and implementation of SRI are:

1. SRI can significantly increase rice yields while using fewer inputs, which makes it a more sustainable and climate-friendly option than traditional rice production methods.

2. SRI requires more labor and management than traditional methods, which can be a challenge in areas where labor is scarce or expensive.

3. SRI has been most successful when implemented on a small scale, such as in farmers' fields or in demonstration projects. Large-scale implementation of SRI has been more difficult and has often resulted in lower yields.

4. SRI requires a good understanding of the local conditions and ecology in order to be successful. In some cases, SRI practices have been adapted to local conditions, such as using different varieties of rice or altering the timing of planting and harvesting.

5. SRI is a complex system, and there is still much to learn about the best ways to implement it.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenge that remains in the development and implementation of System of Rice Intensification is to reverse climate change. The obstacles that need to be overcome to scale up and widely adopt this technology are:

1. Lack of awareness: Most farmers are not aware of the potential of SRI to improve their productivity and incomes.

2. Lack of technical knowledge: Many farmers lack the technical knowledge and skills necessary to implement SRI methods.

3. Lack of financing: SRI requires more upfront investment than traditional rice production methods, making it difficult for smallholder farmers to finance the adoption of SRI.

4. Lack of infrastructure: In many parts of the world, SRI cannot be implemented without the development of infrastructure such as irrigation systems and storage facilities.

5. Political obstacles: In some countries, political factors such as corruption and government policies that favor traditional rice production methods make it difficult to scale up and implement SRI.

## Best Path Forward

There is no silver bullet for mitigating the effects of climate change, but the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) has been shown to be an effective tool for smallholder farmers in adapting to a changing climate. SRI involves a set of practices that optimize the use of land, water, and labor to increase yields while decreasing inputs. These practices can be adapted to the specific conditions of each farm, making SRI an adaptable and scalable technology.

In order for SRI to be adopted on a large scale, it is important to raise awareness of the technology and its potential benefits. farmer training and extension services are critical for ensuring that farmers have the knowledge and skills needed to implement SRI practices on their farms. In addition, it is important to provide financial and technical support to farmers to help offset the costs of adopting SRI.
