## Progress Made

Indigenous Peoples' forest Tenure refers to the legal right of Indigenous Peoples to own, use, and manage their traditional lands and resources. This includes forests, which are an important carbon sink. In the past, Indigenous Peoples have been dispossessed of their land and resources, which has contributed to climate change. However, there has been progress in developing Indigenous Peoples' Forest Tenure to reverse climate change. For example, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) recognizes the rights of Indigenous Peoples to their lands, territories, and resources. This has led to the development of breakthrough technologies, such as satellite mapping, which has helped Indigenous Peoples to better map and manage their lands. This, in turn, has contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Indigenous Peoples’ Forest Tenure to mitigate the effects of climate change include the importance of:

1. Securing land rights for Indigenous communities: It is critical to ensure that Indigenous communities have secure land rights in order to give them the incentive to manage their forests sustainably. Without land tenure security, Indigenous communities are more likely to clear their forests for other uses, such as agriculture.

2. Establishing clear and enforceable rules and regulations: It is important to establish clear and enforceable rules and regulations governing the use of Indigenous Peoples’ forest Tenure. This will help to ensure that the rights of Indigenous communities are respected and that the forests are managed sustainably.

3. Providing adequate financial and technical support: It is important to provide adequate financial and technical support to Indigenous communities to help them establish and maintain their forest Tenure. This will help to ensure that the forests are managed effectively and that the rights of Indigenous communities are respected.

4. Monitoring and evaluating the effects of Indigenous Peoples’ Forest Tenure: It is important to monitor and evaluate the effects of Indigenous Peoples’ Forest Tenure on the environment and on the rights of Indigenous communities. This will help to ensure that the technology is being used effectively and that any negative impacts are addressed.

## Challenges Ahead

There are a number of challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Indigenous Peoples’ forest Tenure to reverse climate change. One challenge is the lack of political will to implement this change at a large scale. Another challenge is the lack of funding to support the development and implementation of Indigenous Peoples’ Forest Tenure. Additionally, there is a need to overcome the challenges associated with changing the current system of forest Tenure, which is deeply entrenched.

## Best Path Forward

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Indigenous Peoples’ Forest Tenure will vary depending on the specific context and needs of each community. However, some general steps that need to be taken to ensure the effective adoption of Indigenous Peoples’ Forest Tenure on a large scale include:

1. Raising awareness of the potential benefits of Indigenous Peoples’ Forest Tenure among forest-dependent communities and other stakeholders.

2. Supporting the capacity building of Indigenous Peoples’ organizations and communities to develop and implement forest Tenure systems.

3. Conducting research to generate evidence on the efficacy of Indigenous Peoples’ Forest Tenure in mitigating the effects of climate change.

4. Mainstreaming Indigenous Peoples’ Forest Tenure into national and international climate change mitigation strategies and initiatives.
