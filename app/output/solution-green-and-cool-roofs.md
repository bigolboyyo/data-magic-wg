## Progress Made

There has been significant progress made in developing Green and Cool Roofs to reverse climate change. Some of the breakthrough technologies that have been developed include:

1. Solar Reflective Roofing: This type of roofing material reflects sunlight away from the building, helping to keep the interior cooler in summer months. This can reduce the need for air conditioning, which saves energy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

2. Green Roofs: Green roofs are covered with vegetation, which helps to insulate the building and reduce the Urban Heat Island Effect. Green roofs also help to filter air pollution and reduce stormwater runoff.

3. Cool Roofs: Cool roofs are designed to reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat than traditional roofs. This can help to keep the interior of a building cooler, reducing the need for air conditioning and saving energy.

All of these technologies have helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by saving energy and reducing the need for air conditioning.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Green and Cool Roofs to mitigate the effects of climate change include the following:

1. Green and cool roofs can be an effective means of mitigating the effects of climate change, including reducing energy consumption and improving air quality.

2. There are a number of different green and cool roof technologies available, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

3. Green and cool roofs must be designed and installed properly in order to be effective.

4. Green and cool roofs require ongoing maintenance and inspection to ensure their efficacy.

5. Green and cool roofs can be expensive to install and maintain, and their benefits may not always be immediately apparent.

Despite these challenges, green and cool roofs offer a number of potential benefits that make them an attractive option for mitigating the effects of climate change.

## Challenges Ahead

One of the key challenges for green and cool roofs is the lack of awareness and understanding of the benefits of these technologies. There is a need for more education and outreach to help people understand how green and cool roofs can help mitigate climate change. Additionally, there are challenges associated with the cost of these technologies and the need for more incentives to encourage adoption. There is also a need for more research to improve the performance of these technologies and to develop new and innovative approaches to their installation and maintenance.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Green and Cool Roofs to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to develop and implement these technologies on a large scale. Steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing awareness of the benefits of green and cool roofs among the general public and policy makers.

2. Providing incentives for the adoption of green and cool roofs, such as tax breaks or other financial incentives.

3. Developing building codes and regulations that mandate the use of green and cool roofs on new buildings or building renovations.

4. Conducting research to further improve the efficiency of green and cool roofs.

5. Working with the building industry to ensure that green and cool roofs are properly designed and installed.
