## Progress Made

The progress that has been made in developing Distributed Solar Photovoltaics to reverse climate change is significant. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has been evolving rapidly over the last few decades, and the cost of solar PV systems has fallen dramatically. As a result, solar PV is now one of the most cost-effective ways to generate electricity, and its use is growing rapidly around the world.

One of the biggest breakthroughs in solar PV technology has been the development of thin-film solar cells. Thin-film solar cells are made from a variety of materials, including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). These materials can be deposited on a substrate in a very thin layer, typically less than a micron thick. This makes thin-film solar cells much lighter and more flexible than traditional solar cells made from crystalline silicon.

Another breakthrough has been the development of solar PV modules with higher power output. In the past, most solar PV modules had power ratings of around 60-100 watts. But now, there are modules available with power ratings of up to 400 watts. This means that you can generate more electricity from a given area of land, or that you can reduce the size of your solar PV system for a given power output.

Finally, the progress that has been made in developing solar PV systems that can be integrated into the built environment is also significant. There are now solar PV systems available that can be used as roofs, walls, and even windows. This means that solar PV can be used to generate electricity in a way that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional.

All of these breakthroughs have contributed to the rapid growth of solar PV around the world. Solar PV is now the fastest-growing source of electricity, and it is playing a key role in the transition to a low-carbon economy.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Distributed Solar Photovoltaics to mitigate the effects of climate change are as follows:

1. One of the main lessons learned is that solar PV can be a very effective tool for mitigating climate change, as it can displace fossil fuels and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

2. Another key lesson is that solar PV can be a cost-effective way to generate electricity, especially when compared to other renewable energy technologies.

3. A third lesson is that solar PV systems need to be designed and installed properly in order to be effective and efficient. This includes ensuring that the system is sized correctly for the specific location, that it receives enough sunlight, and that it is properly maintained.

4. A fourth lesson is that solar PV can provide other benefits besides reducing greenhouse gas emissions, such as creating jobs, reducing air pollution, and providing energy security.

Despite these lessons, there have been some failures associated with the technology. One of the main failures has been the high cost of solar PV, which has made it difficult for many people to afford. Additionally, solar PV requires a lot of land area, which can be a problem in some locations. Another failure has been the intermittency of solar PV, which means that it does not produce electricity all the time. This can be a problem when there is a high demand for electricity, such as during a heat wave.

## Challenges Ahead

There are a number of challenges that need to be overcome to fully develop and implement distributed solar photovoltaics (DSPV) to reverse climate change. One of the biggest challenges is the high upfront cost of installing solar panels. Another challenge is the need for a reliable and affordable storage solution to store the energy generated by the solar panels. Additionally, there are challenges associated with the siting of solar panels, as well as the permitting and interconnection process. Finally, there is the challenge of educating the public about the benefits of solar energy and overcoming the resistance to change.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of distributed solar photovoltaics to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to improve the technology and make it more affordable. Steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing public awareness of the benefits of solar PV and the potential for climate change mitigation.

2. Providing financial incentives for solar PV adoption, such as tax credits or subsidies.

3. Streamlining the process for installing solar PV systems.

4. Improving the technology to make it more efficient and affordable.
