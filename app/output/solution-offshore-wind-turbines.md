## Progress Made

The development of onshore wind turbines has progressed rapidly in recent years, thanks to advances in technology. Breakthrough technologies include more efficient blades, taller towers, and stronger foundations. These technologies have helped to reduce the cost of onshore wind energy, making it more competitive with other forms of energy. As a result, onshore wind energy has been growing rapidly, with installations increasing by 25% per year over the past decade. This growth is expected to continue, as onshore wind is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Lessons Learned

There are a number of key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Onshore Wind Turbines to mitigate the effects of climate change. One of the most important lessons is the need for careful siting of wind turbines. Turbines must be sited in areas where there is enough wind to power them, but not so much wind that they are constantly at risk of being blown over. Another important lesson is the need for regular maintenance of turbines. Turbines must be regularly inspected and cleaned to ensure that they are operating at peak efficiency.

One of the biggest challenges in the development of Onshore Wind Turbines has been the need to mitigate the visual impact of the turbines. In many cases, turbines have been installed in areas where they are highly visible, such as on mountain ridges. This has led to public opposition in some cases, and has made it difficult to get approval for new projects. To address this issue, developers have begun to use taller towers and to install turbines in groups, which can help to reduce the visual impact.

## Challenges Ahead

The challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Onshore Wind Turbines to reverse climate change are:

1. The need for more efficient and powerful turbines: The current onshore wind turbines are not powerful enough to make a significant dent in the global carbon emissions. To make a difference, the turbines need to be more efficient and produce more power.

2. The need for more land: Onshore wind turbines need a lot of land to be effective. This means that they need to be built in areas where there is a lot of open space. This can be a challenge in densely populated areas.

3. The need for more investment: Onshore wind turbines are expensive to build and maintain. This means that there needs to be a lot of investment in order to make them widespread.

4. The need for more public support: In order for onshore wind turbines to be widely adopted, there needs to be more public support for them. This includes support from governments and from the general public.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Onshore Wind Turbines to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to improve the technology so that it is more efficient and less expensive. Additionally, it is important to continue to raise awareness about the benefits of onshore wind turbines and to advocate for their adoption on a large scale.
